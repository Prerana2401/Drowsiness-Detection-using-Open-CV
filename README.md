# Drowsiness-Detection-using-Open-CV
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system capable of accurately detecting driver drowsiness in real-time, utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, the system processes video frames, identifies facial landmarks, and calculates key metrics to assess the driver's alertness level. Upon detecting signs of drowsiness, the system triggers an alert mechanism to prevent potential accidents.
